BMI (body mass index) calculator implementations

In 2014 I was a relatively new javascript developer primarily using jQuery Mobile for my UI.  I was also on a personal journey to lose weight.  Being a developer I liked seeing my efforts represented in some form of standard.  So I created a simple page that would show me my current BMI and the various categories of BMIs for my height.  I put the page up on my abiansoftware.com domain and never really worked on it after posting it.

I have gained a bit of javascript experience since creating this page and I was getting interested in other frameworks so I decided to reimplement this page using some different frameworks to get a feel for them.
