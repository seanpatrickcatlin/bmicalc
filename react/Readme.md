#bmicalc - react

react 0.13.3 implementation
---

I have been interested in doing something with react for a while so I figure I would implement my bmi calculator in react.

To run the code simply execute the following commands in the root of this react proejct:
* npm install
* npm start

That will generate the bundle.js file in the www directory.
